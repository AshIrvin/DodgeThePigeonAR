## General info
A game idea I had 1 night and decided to set it up. 

We're a nation of mobile phone users staring at out phones while walking on the pavement. Well, why not play a game while doing it!

Save Dodge the pidgeon from getting trampled on by other people!

Using your phone's camera facing the ground, a pigeon will appear and you need to navigate it to safety while making sure it gets all the bread crumbs.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Unity
* Thats it - very very early
